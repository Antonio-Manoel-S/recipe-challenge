### What I learned
 I know more about using Markers using ::marker, position elements to look like spreadsheet with {position:absolute} and make the border solid in the bottom of div.

## Acknowledgments

I wanted to do the responsive mobile look more to the mobile design in the example, but i struggle to make the first photo cover all the top at the start of html. If the photo was right before the principal div "Slider" it would identical, but, i didn't manage to do that without undo the site design, that the image of egg is inside of the principal div - in my case, the Main "Slider"-. So i leave the responsive just like that, covering the width without the height that i wanted.

# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

This is a solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge
 Manipulate LI markers, make a spreadsheet with items aligned.

## My process

### Built with
- Editor Spck [mobile]

### What I learned
 With the function onclick="window.location.href="(httpsEndress";" inside the button tag you can make a button link, besides you can simply create the <a> tag and do a css to let it does like a button. I choose do the <button> tag with the function.

## Acknowledgments

I got a little truble messing with my photo, when i forgot putting max-width:100%; so, do a reset css with the image{} is a deal. Sure, you can discard if you dont have a img to use or custom width. I plan reuse/rework a new profile site on the future, when i learn more about Javascript.
